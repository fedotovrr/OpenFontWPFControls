 ### Text controls for WPF
Specialized: Drawing color text, stylized text and very long text

Not used `System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument` and `System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox`

Base on  [Typography.OpenFont](https://github.com/samhocevar-forks/typography/tree/master/Typography.OpenFont) (Sorry, I don't know how to add a link, like it was done in [Emoji.WPF](https://github.com/samhocevar/emoji.wpf))
